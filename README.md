# expo.todo.elements
A Todo App written in React Native Elements using Expo

## Why
A simple "TODO" application, which however introduces many important concepts, persistent and asynchronous storage, scrolling lists, native alerts, nested components written with functional syntax and hooks.
An article will follow soon.

## Syntax
I hate PascalCase and therefore apart from the components which is mandatory, the methods are in snake_case, the indentation is four spaces, because a farsighted person like me considers the use of 2 spaces a crime, for the same reason I find the brackets on the same line criminal, the only real programming style is the Allman Style.

## UI
I used "react native elements" because it's a fantastic library and has great expo support.
